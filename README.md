## 🌿 About Sparta-Lens-ETHNYC

Sparta-Lens-ETHNYC is a decentralized fitness social media app built with [Lens Protocol](http://lens.dev/) 🌿 and forked from Lenster [(lenster.xyz)](https://lenster.xyz/) during the ETHNYC 2022 hackathon. The goal was to simply filter for sparta-only posts and test the concept using a previously built out social media app on Lens. The full scale build will be built from scratch.
